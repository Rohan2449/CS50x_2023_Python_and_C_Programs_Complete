Questions:

Which predictions, if any, proved incorrect as you increased the number of simulations?:

The smaller simulations, such as 10 or 100, proved incorrect as I increased the number of simulations

Suppose you're charged a fee for each second of compute time your program uses.
After how many simulations would you call the predictions "good enough"?:

After 1000 simulations, there is no need to perform more predictions, as the results vary only
slightly while the run time increases drastically after 1000 simulations.
