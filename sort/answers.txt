sort1 uses: bubble

How do you know?: The run time of the sorted list is the quickest since the outer loop runs only once.
                  It has the fastest run time on a sorted list.

sort2 uses: merge

How do you know?: The run time is fast and consistent, therefore it is merge sort and not selection sort.

sort3 uses: selection

How do you know?: the run time is slower than sort2, but since all the lists had similar run times this must be selection sort.
